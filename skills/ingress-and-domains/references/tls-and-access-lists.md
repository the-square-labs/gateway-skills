# TLS certificates and Access Lists

## SSL certificate sources

Every source produces an **SSL certificate** entity whose ID is a Route's `sslCertificateId`.

- **ACME (Let's Encrypt):** `request_acme_cert({ domains, challengeType: "http-01" | "dns-01", dnsProvider? })`.
  - `http-01` needs the Domain's assigned nginx Node online and reachable on port 80.
  - `dns-01` with a configured Cloudflare connector creates, verifies, and cleans up TXT records automatically.
  - Manual `dns-01` returns `{ domain, recordName, recordValue }`. Give the user the record, wait for them, then confirm with `manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "verify_dns", sslCertificateId })`.
  - Certificates renew automatically 30 days before expiry (checked daily). DNS-01 renewal requires Cloudflare; toggle it with `manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "set_auto_renew", ... })`.
- **Upload:** `manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "upload", certificatePem, privateKeyPem, chainPem? })`. Uploaded certificates do not renew; they must be replaced before expiry. A private key is a secret: take it from a local file the user named, never from chat, and never print it.
- **Internal PKI:** issue a certificate with `internal-pki`, then `link_internal_cert({ internalCertId })` creates the SSL certificate entry. Use that new SSL ID, never the PKI certificate ID.

`list_ssl_certificates` lists them; `manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "renew", ... })` reissues now (an internally linked certificate also needs `pki:cert:issue` on its CA). `ssl:cert:issue` and `ssl:cert:delete` are OAuth manual-approval scopes.

## Access Lists

- `create_access_list` takes `allowIps` and `denyIps` string arrays plus `basicAuthUsers`.
- `manage_access_list({ operation: "get" | "update", accessListId, ... })` updates `name`, `description`, ordered `ipRules: [{ type: "allow" | "deny", value }]` (first match wins), `basicAuthEnabled`, and `basicAuthUsers: [{ username, password }]`. Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes and deployed to Nodes as htpasswd files.
- `list_access_lists`; `delete_access_list` detaches the list from every Route first.
- One list can serve many Routes and Page Projects; an edit applies to all of them at once, so check who uses a list before changing it.

Credentials: never generate, request, or relay basic-auth passwords in chat. Create lists with IP rules, reuse an existing list, or let the user add basic-auth users in the Gateway Console and then attach the list by ID. An agent cannot fetch a basic-auth-protected URL without credentials; a 401 response is the expected evidence that protection applies.
