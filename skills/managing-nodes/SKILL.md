description: Enroll, inspect, and operate Gateway Nodes, the servers running Gateway daemons for nginx ingress, Docker, builder, storage and databases, monitoring, and relay. Use when asked to add a server to Gateway, check Node or daemon health, change a Node's service address, open a Node console or browse its filesystem, update daemons, or diagnose an offline or degraded Node. For a brand-new installation, start with the instance setup in using-gateway. Use after using-gateway has confirmed the Gateway MCP connection.

# Managing Nodes

Nodes are servers running a Gateway daemon that connects to the control plane over mutual-TLS gRPC (port 9443). A Node's type decides what it can run, and a Node is never silently repurposed to another type.

Start with `using-gateway` for connection, discovery, and safety rules; its instance-setup reference covers a brand-new control plane and first Nodes. Read `read_gateway_documentation({ topic: "nodes" })` (and `node-files`) before enrollment or file work: it has the current setup scripts, the manual-install fallback, and every reported health field.

## Node types

| Type | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| `nginx` | Ingress: Routes, TLS replicas, Access Lists, public traffic, Pages publication |
| `docker` | Containers, Deployments, images, volumes, networks, Compose Projects |
| `builder` | Isolated Git builds through a dedicated BuildKit and containerd profile, with no Docker socket |
| `storage` | Managed PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, managed SeaweedFS (and legacy MinIO), bounded backup jobs |
| `databases` | Legacy database-only profile, superseded by `storage` for new capacity |
| `monitoring` | Lightweight system metrics; no nginx or Docker required |
| `relay` | Secure Link Relay Pool worker; needs an advertised address reachable by participating hosts |

Enroll only the roles the workload needs.

## Enroll a Node

Adding a server is an explicit infrastructure mutation; do it only on the user's request.

1. Prefer the Console flow (**Nodes > Add Node**): it shows the one-time enrollment command directly to the user, so the token never passes through chat.
2. `create_node({ type, displayName, ... })` (relay Nodes also need the advertised address) is the MCP equivalent. It returns a one-time enrollment token and the Gateway gRPC certificate fingerprint. Use it only when you will run the setup command on the target host yourself, with the user's authorization. Otherwise let the user use the Console.
3. Run the exact setup command Gateway documents for the type (`setup-<type>-node.sh` with `--gateway <host>:9443 --token ... --gateway-cert-sha256 sha256:...`, plus `--mode builder` for builders and `--storage-root <path> --yes` for unattended storage Nodes). Pass the token straight into that command; never print it, log it, store it, or repeat it. Never reconstruct a token, target, or fingerprint by hand.
4. The script installs the daemon, writes its config, starts a systemd service, and the daemon enrolls over mTLS. The token works once.
5. Poll `get_node` until the status moves from `pending` to `online`, then check the capability report (daemon version, features) before relying on the Node.

Never delete a Node record while its old daemon might still reconnect: deletion creates a new durable identity and blocks safe reconciliation. For a stuck offline Node, diagnose host power and network, system time, DNS, the daemon service, certificate identity, and outbound relay reachability before considering delete and re-enroll.

## Operate Nodes

- `list_nodes`, `get_node` (`nodes:details`); `rename_node` (`nodes:rename`); `delete_node` (`nodes:delete`).
- `manage_node_config` reads (`nodes:config:view`), updates, or tests (`nodes:manage`) the global nginx configuration. Test before update.
- `set_node_service_creation_lock` locks or unlocks creation of new services on a Node; `manage_relay_pool` manages relay Nodes.
- A Docker, database, or storage Node can set an explicit `serviceAddress` for cross-node and upstream reachability (`nodes:manage`); otherwise Gateway uses the first reported local address, then a public one.
- Daemon mTLS certificates renew automatically once a third of their lifetime remains; Gateway alerts below 30 days.
- Daemon updates come from the `maintenance` toolset (`manage_system_updates`; `read_gateway_documentation({ topic: "licensing-updates" })`). Update per `nodeId`, never "everything" at once.

## Console and files

- `execute_node_console_command({ nodeId, command: ["sh", "-lc", "..."] })` runs one command in a real PTY on the host OS. It needs `nodes:console`, an OAuth manual-approval scope. Gateway blocks obviously catastrophic patterns, but treat every command as a host mutation that needs user intent.
- `manage_node_file` lists, reads, writes, creates, moves, and deletes files through the daemon, with chunked `upload_init`, `upload_chunk`, `upload_complete`, and `upload_abort`. Reads (`nodes:files:read`) are capped and report `truncated`; any change needs `nodes:files:write`. Both are manual-approval scopes.
- Do not use the console to work around a type's design, such as giving a builder a Docker socket. Docker Nodes report Secure Runtime (gVisor) setup state; install it through Gateway's setup entrypoint, not the console, unless the user explicitly asks for host-level repair.

## Health

Health reports arrive every 30 seconds: CPU, memory, disk, load, swap, network, and type-specific data (nginx workers and 4xx/5xx rates; Docker container counts and stats). A disconnected Node shows its last known snapshot, and Gateway blocks mutations that would rely on unverified state.

## Verify

- After enrollment: `get_node` reports `online` with a fresh capability report.
- After a config or service-address change: re-read the Node; for nginx, the `test` passed and Routes on the Node still resolve.
- After console or file repairs: the symptom itself is gone (service running, disk freed), not only a zero exit code.

## Pitfalls

- A green connection indicator does not prove that Routes, certificates, workloads, or bindings on the Node converged after reconnect; check each resource family.
- A deleted Node record does not mean its workloads are gone: nginx, Docker, and database services may keep running independently.
