description: Deploy and operate Docker workloads on Gateway, including standalone Containers, blue/green Deployments with rollback, Compose Projects, Git-source builds into Gateway's internal registry, images, registries, volumes, networks, folders, and cross-node migration. Use when asked to run, update, roll out, roll back, recreate, migrate, or inspect a container, Deployment, or Compose Project on a Gateway-managed Docker Node, or to deploy a repository with a Dockerfile or Compose file through Gateway. Use after using-gateway has confirmed the Gateway MCP connection.

# Deploying Workloads

Gateway manages Docker on enrolled Docker Nodes and adds three native models: blue/green **Deployments**, **Compose Projects** with immutable revisions, and **Git sources** that build digest-pinned artifacts into Gateway's internal registry. Every Docker tool needs a `nodeId`; resolve names, images, and domains with `find_resource` first.

Start with `using-gateway` for connection, discovery, and safety rules. Read `read_gateway_documentation({ topic: "docker" })` before a multi-step workflow; it documents argument shapes this skill only summarizes. Exact tool names and operation enums: [Docker tool catalog](references/docker-tools.md).

## Pick the resource model

| The application is | Use |
| --- | --- |
| One ordinary service | Standalone Container (`create_docker_container`, lifecycle tools) |
| A service that needs health-checked cutover and rollback | Blue/green Deployment (`manage_docker_deployment`, `deploy_docker_deployment`, `switch_docker_deployment_slot`, `rollback_docker_deployment`) |
| Several services, or a repository that already defines Compose | Compose Project (`manage_docker_compose`, Personal plan or higher; every plan can read label-detected projects) |
| A repository to build rather than a published image | A Git source attached to any of the above (`manage_docker_source`, Business or Enterprise for new builds) |
| The same workload on several Docker Nodes with failover | The above plus `high-availability` |

If an existing Container, Deployment, or Compose Project already represents the application, update it or attach a source to it instead of creating a duplicate. If the repository already has a healthy release pipeline, keep it unless the user asks to replace it.

## Git source builds

1. `manage_docker_source({ operation: "admission", ... })` before promising a build. Admission needs the entitlement, a writable internal registry, an allowlisted Git connector, and an online Build Worker advertising the enforced capabilities. If it fails, report the returned prerequisite; never create an external CI pipeline as a silent workaround.
2. `connectors` and `repositories` list the allowlisted sources. Resolve the requested branch to an exact commit.
3. `create` makes a new Container, Deployment, or Compose Project from the source (`targetType: "container" | "deployment" | "compose"`); `upsert` attaches or changes the source of an existing one. Keep non-secret `buildArgs`, Build Secrets (`secret_upsert`, write-only), and runtime secrets separate. Saving a source needs `integrations:<provider>:use` on the repository (a project-level grant is enough). Automatic builds of a source saved in this release run only while the account that saved it still holds that `use`; otherwise the build history shows a cancelled "Build paused: <user> no longer has use on <repo>" until access returns or someone with `use` saves the source again.
4. `build` queues a build and checks your own `use` on the saved repository; follow it with `list_docker_builds` and `manage_docker_build` (status, incremental logs, cancel, retry). While a build rollout deploys, other changes to its target are refused with `409 BUILD_ROLLOUT_IN_PROGRESS`.
5. The runtime identity is the approved, digest-pinned artifact, never a branch or mutable tag. With `autoDeploy`, Gateway recreates the workload from that digest.

Compose sources and bounded build fields: [Compose and Git builds](references/compose-and-git-builds.md).

## Standalone Containers

1. Check `list_docker_images({ nodeId })`. If the image is missing, `pull_docker_image` and wait for the pull Task to finish; a failed create is not an image-existence probe. Public Docker Hub images need no registry.
2. `create_docker_container({ nodeId, image, name, ports?, volumes?, env?, networks?, restartPolicy?, ... })` with Gateway-managed volumes and explicit networks.
3. Change the image with `update_docker_container_image`: it pulls fully on the target Node, then recreates; a failed pull leaves the old Container running. Restart policy and CPU, memory, and PID limits apply live; ports, volumes, entrypoint, command, working directory, hostname, labels, and image require recreate.
4. Lifecycle: `start_docker_container`, `stop_docker_container`, `restart_docker_container`, `kill_docker_container`, `rename_docker_container`, `remove_docker_container` (stopped Containers only; volumes stay), and `duplicate_docker_container` (clones configuration and secrets under a new name, without reserved Compose and Gateway labels; a Docker daemon too old to drop them refuses with `UNSUPPORTED_DAEMON`). A name reserved by a Git source still waiting for its first build cannot be taken by create, duplicate or rename (`NAME_IN_USE`).
5. Inspect with `get_docker_container`, `get_docker_container_stats`, and `get_docker_container_logs`.

Container IDs change on every recreate. If a tool returns "No such container", re-resolve by name before concluding anything was deleted. Permission grants follow the stable name across recreate and update; an explicit deletion drops them.

## Blue/green Deployments

Operate the Deployment, never its slot Containers. `deploy_docker_deployment` rolls a new image to the inactive slot; verify that slot's health; `switch_docker_deployment_slot` moves traffic; keep the previous slot warm; `rollback_docker_deployment` returns to the previous release. Never switch before the new slot meets its health condition.

## Compose Projects

`manage_docker_compose` covers projects, immutable revisions, operation history, lifecycle, and masked secrets. One project runs on one Docker Node. Manual YAML is image-only; repository Compose files may use the bounded build subset through a Git source. Start, stop, restart, apply, pull and apply, `down`, cancellation, project deletion, and volume deletion are distinct operations: `down` and volume deletion need explicit user intent. Never mutate a project-owned child Container, network, or volume directly. Invariants and validation rules: [Compose and Git builds](references/compose-and-git-builds.md).

## Images, volumes, networks, registries, and migration

Registries, Gateway-managed volumes, networks, folders, cross-node migration (`preflight` before `start`), archive export and import, and Secure Runtime limits: [Resources and migration](references/resources-and-migration.md).

## Secrets and interactive access

- Secret environment values are encrypted at rest, keyed by Container name so they survive recreate, and visible only with `docker:containers:secrets`. Never ask for a value in chat: let the user enter it in the Gateway Console, or pass it from a local source the user named without echoing it.
- `execute_docker_container_console_command` runs a real command in the Container. It needs `docker:containers:console` (an OAuth manual-approval scope); Gateway blocks obviously catastrophic patterns, but treat every command as a mutation that needs user intent.

## Verify

- Container or Deployment: reported running state, clean recent logs, health, and, when routed, an external HTTPS response.
- Build: terminal success in `manage_docker_build` and the produced artifact digest, not "queued".
- Compose: the new revision applied, every expected service healthy, drift clean.
- Migration: the resource healthy on the target Node and source cleanup completed.

## Pitfalls

- Transitions (stopping, restarting, recreating, deploying, switching) block concurrent operations on the same resource. Follow the Task instead of retrying.
- Pulls use the target Node's registry access; images are not copied between Docker Nodes.
- Stop, restart, kill, recreate, update, build, and migration are Tasks. A slow response is not a failure; never repeat a create or delete after a timeout before reconciling.
- Never introduce host bind mounts, privileged mode, device access, or Docker socket access.
